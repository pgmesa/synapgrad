# Basic implementation of Deep Neural Networks from scratch

python >= 3.9

[ ! ] This project is currently being developed...

This project tries to implement a basic deep learning library (feedforward, gradients, backprogragation,...), without using any existing framework such as keras, pytorch, tensorflow, sklearn, etc. 

To execute on GPU, 'numba' and 'cudatoolkit' could be use, but it is out of the scope of this project.

## Examples

This project comes with 3 jupyter notebooks that solve 3 well known beginner's problems in AI:
- Basic MLP for Iris Flower classification
- MLP for handwritten digits classification (MNIST dataset) 
- CNN for handwritten digits classification (MNIST dataset)
